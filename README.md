This is a set of photograph cards that expand when clicked. This was achieved using css transitions and a little javascript.
I'm pleased with the way this turned out because it's the first time i've used transitions. Using the media query with nth of 
type pseudoselectors was straightforward as well. I remember more about the syntax than I feared. 

I used JavaScript for selecting the active panels and in the process learned more about node lists, arrays, and manipulating the DOM.
